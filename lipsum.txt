My name is Ludwig van Beethoven. I was born in Bonn, a city in Germany. When I was very small, my father taught me to play the piano. He was a strict teacher, but I loved to practice. I also sang in the choir at the church.
One day, a famous musician named Christian Gottlob Neefe came to visit our city. He heard me play and said, “This boy is a genius!” My father was very proud. Neefe became my teacher, and I learned a lot from him.
When I was fourteen years old, my mother died. It was a very sad time for our family. I had to take care of my younger brothers and sisters. Even though it was hard, I continued to practice the piano and compose music.
